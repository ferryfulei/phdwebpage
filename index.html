              <p> Lulai Zhu obtained a BEng and an MEng in Measurement Technology and
                Instruments from Sichuan University, China, in 2008 and 2011 respectively.
                 After that, he joined Emerson Network Power and had been working as a software
                  test engineer for four years. He received in 2016 an MSc in Computing Science from
                   Imperial College London, UK, and is now a doctoral student in the Department of
                   Computing under the supervision of Dr. Giuliano Casale. His PhD study aims to
                    contribute analytical methods for solving performance models such as queueing networks
                    and Petri nets, with a particular focus on fluid approximation. He recently worked as a
                    research assistant in the DICE project on performance modeling and simulation, and would play
                    a similar role in the RADON project on architectural decomposition and optimization. He is also
                    an active maintainer of the well-known JMT suite.</p>

              <h3>Thesis Abstract</h3>
              <p>As a multi-class variant of the classical egalitarian processor-sharing (EPS) discipline,
                 discriminatory processor sharing (DPS) provides a suitable approach to model time-sharing
                 operating systems and packet-switched communication networks where share exists to control
                 the service. Although DPS is a more general scheduling discipline than the EPS, queueing
                  models with DPS are of non-product form and thus far less mathematically tractable than
                  those with EPS. A fluid approach is proposed in my PhD thesis for transient and steady-state
                   analysis of closed QNs comprising delay and DPS queueing stations. By this approach,
                    the expected sample path of a closed QN with DPS can be approximated using the solution
                    to a system of ordinary differential equations, which is admitted to be unique in any finite time horizon.</p>

              <h5>Performance Evaluation with Java Modelling Tools:: A Hands-on Introduction</h5>
              <p>The goal of this tutorial is to introduce Java Modelling Tools (JMT), an open source framework for discrete-event simulation and analysis of queueing networks, both product-form and extended, generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPNs), and queueing Petri nets (QPNs). Thanks to a user-friendly graphical interface, JMT is well-suited to teach performance modeling in academia and to help research students familiarize with classic modeling formalisms used in performance evaluation. The tutorial introduces established and novel features of the JMT suite and illustrates them on case studies.</p>
              <h5>Generalized Synchronizations and Capacity Constraints for Java Modelling Tools</h5>
              <p>Java Modelling Tools (JMT) is a suite of performance evaluation tools based on queueing network models. Recently {\em JSIMgraph}, the JMT discrete-event simulation tool, has been extended to express features of current computing systems such as Big data applications. The goal of this demonstration is to showcase novel support in JMT for fork-join synchronization, dynamic scaling of parallelism levels, memory and group capacity constraints.</p>
